# unsupervised_knn_clustering_from_scratch

A small implementation I made of K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) unsupervised clustering I made from scratch to help demonstrate how it works. This is just for demonstration purposes so you can follow the logic of the code step by step. When implementing for production use-cases I would recommend you use a optimised library (e.g. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) as my implementation is not vectorized for optimal performance and does not have many of the scaling and tuning parameters avalible in packages like sklearn.
