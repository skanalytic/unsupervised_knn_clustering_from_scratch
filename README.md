# unsupervised_knn_clustering_from_scratch

A toy implementation of K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) unsupervised clustering I made from scratch to help demonstrate how thie algorithm works. This is just for demonstration purposes to allow people to follow the logic step by step. When implementing for production use-cases I would highly recommend using an optimised library (e.g. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) as this implementation is not vectorized for optimal performance and does not have many of the scaling and tuning parameters avalible in packages like sklearn.
